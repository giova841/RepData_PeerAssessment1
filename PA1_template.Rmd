## Loading and preprocessing the data
This is the code needed to

1. Load the data (i.e. `read.csv()`)

2. Process/transform the data into a format suitable for your analysis

### Load the data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses=c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))
```

### Process/transfomr the data

Now let explore the data by defining the size, the variable names and a short 
preview of the dataset.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dim(activity)
names(activity)
head(activity)
str(activity)
```

There are some 'NA' in the dataset that should be later managed.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
#total number of missing data
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

In this dataset the overall number of days covered is:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
length(unique(activity$date))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment we ignore the missing values in
the dataset.

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day

### Make a histogram of the total number of steps per day

```{r, echo = TRUE}
totalStepsDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
head(totalStepsDay)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(totalStepsDay$steps, xlab="Class of Total Number of Steps per day", ylab="Number of Days", main="Total number of steps per day")
```

### Calculate the mean and median of the steps per day

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean_raw<-mean(totalStepsDay$steps)
mean_raw
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
median_raw<-median(totalStepsDay$steps)
median_raw
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

### Time series plot

The average number of steps taken:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
averageStepsbyInterval<-aggregate(steps~interval, activity, mean)
```

Time series plot of the average number of steps taken:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
with(averageStepsbyInterval, plot(interval, steps, type = "l"))
```

### text
```{r, echo = TRUE}
averageStepsbyInterval[which.max(averageStepsbyInterval[,2]),1]
```

## Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing
values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce
bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with `NA`s)

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the `weekdays()` function may be of some help here. Use
the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

1. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following, which was created using **simulated data**:

![Sample panel plot](instructions_fig/sample_panelplot.png) 

**Your plot will look different from the one above** because you will
be using the activity monitor data. Note that the above plot was made
using the lattice system but you can make the same version of the plot
using any plotting system you choose.
